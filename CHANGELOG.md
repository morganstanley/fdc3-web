## 0.8.1 (2025-10-29)

Added support for passing multiple local apps to app directory through `updates` AsyncIterator

## 0.8.0 (2025-10-29)

Support added for adding and updating local app directory records after creation of the app directory:

```ts
let addAppToDirectory: ((value: LocalAppDirectoryEntry) => void) | undefined;

const updates: AsyncIterator<LocalAppDirectoryEntry> = {
    next: async () =>
        new Promise<IteratorResult<LocalAppDirectoryEntry>>(resolve => {
            addAppToDirectory = value => resolve({ done: false, value });
        }),
};

getAgent({
    failover: () =>
        new DesktopAgentFactory().createRoot({
            rootAppId: 'test-harness-root-app',
            appDirectoryEntries: [
                {
                    host: 'example.com',
                    apps: [
                        {
                            appId: 'local-app-id',
                            title: 'Local App',
                            url: 'https://example.com/someApp',
                        },
                    ],
                    updates,
                },
            ],
        }),
});
```

## 0.7.0 (2025-10-21)

### Breaking

Locally defined app directories force the app directory host to be specified separately to ensure all apps in the same directory have the same host for the fully qualified id.

```ts
getAgent({
    failover: () =>
        new DesktopAgentFactory().createRoot({
            rootAppId: 'test-harness-root-app',
            appDirectoryEntries: [
                [
                    {
                        appId: 'local-app-id',
                        title: 'Local App',
                        url: 'https://example.com/someApp',
                    },
                ],
            ],
        }),
});
```

becomes:

```ts
getAgent({
    failover: () =>
        new DesktopAgentFactory().createRoot({
            rootAppId: 'test-harness-root-app',
            appDirectoryEntries: [
                {
                    host: "example.com",
                    apps: [
                        {
                            appId: 'local-app-id',
                            title: 'Local App',
                            url: 'https://example.com/someApp',
                        },
                ]
                },
            ],
        }),
});
```

### Changed

Implemented a better url comparison function for verifying app identity against app directory. This function now considers all aspects of the url including query params, hash and path segments. This allows apps on the same host to be differentiated:

```
http://myhost.com/pathOne/pathTwo?appId=appOne
http://myhost.com/pathOne/pathTwo?appId=appTwo
http://myhost.com/pathOne/pathTwo?appId=appOne#additionalModifier
http://myhost.com/pathOne/pathTwo/pathThree?appId=appOne
```
all of these urls can be defined as separate apps in the app directory.

## 0.6.0 (2025-10-07)

### Added:

`IOpenApplicationStrategy` now accepts the optional associated context object for window opening as params on the `canOpen` and `open` functions

## 0.5.0 (2025-10-03)

### Breaking:

`appDirectoryUrls` in `RootDesktopAgentFactoryParams` has been renamed to `appDirectoryEntries`:

```ts
new DesktopAgentFactory().createRoot({
    appDirectoryUrls: ['http://localhost:4299/v2/apps'],
}),
```

becomes:

```ts
new DesktopAgentFactory().createRoot({
    appDirectoryEntries: ['http://localhost:4299/v2/apps'],
}),
```

### Added:

Added for support for locally defined App Directories to eliminate the need to host an app directory on a server:

```ts
getAgent({
    failover: () =>
        new DesktopAgentFactory().createRoot({
            rootAppId: 'test-harness-root-app',
            appDirectoryEntries: [
                [
                    {
                        appId: 'local-app-id',
                        title: 'Local App',
                        url: 'https://example.com/someApp',
                    },
                ],
            ],
        }),
});
```

## 0.4.0 (2025-10-01)

Root app id is no longer resolved from the app directory but instead is passed in to the root app constructor:

```ts
getAgent({
    failover: () =>
        new DesktopAgentFactory().createRoot({
            rootAppId: 'test-harness-root-app' // can also pass a fully qualified id: test-harness-root-app@host.com
        }),
});
```

This makes it possible to run the container app without an app directory as this is no longer required to resolve the appId.

## 0.3.5 (2025-09-26)

Fixed generated package.json by removing incorrect module entry

## 0.3.4 (2025-08-08)

When handshake messages are not responded to by applications after 3 attempts that application is removed from the app resolver.
When an application is closed a WCP6Goodbye message is sent to the root agent and the application is removed from the app resolver.

## 0.3.3 (2025-08-04)

Fixed bugs around open strategies. Strategies that return `false` from `canOpen` are now correctly skipped and not used to open windows.

## 0.3.2 (2025-06-26)

 - Fixed a bug with `createRoot` that did not correctly pass the `identityUrl` to the `rootMessagePublisher`
 - Changed the `getAppDirectoryApplicationsImpl` to not append `/v2/apps` to app directory urls to allow non standard urls to be used

## 0.3.1 (2025-06-03)

Fixed a bug with `app-resolver.default` and `app-resolver.component` that did not automatically select an unqualified app id when there was only 1 suitable app available.
